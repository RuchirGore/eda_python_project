# SPOTIFY_Data Visualization Project

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of a Spotify dataset using Python and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The dataset ('spotify.csv') contains information about various songs, including features like popularity, energy, genre, and more.

## Project Structure

- **`SPOTIFY_Data Visualization.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data loading, exploration, and visualization.
- **`spotify.csv`**: Dataset used for analysis.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation.

## Analysis Highlights
1)Data Loading and Exploration: Utilized Pandas to load the dataset, perform basic statistics, and explore data characteristics.

2)Top 10 Most and Least Popular Songs: Identified the songs with the highest and lowest popularity.

3)Data Visualization: Utilized Seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualizations such as count plots, box plots, scatter plots, and more to gain insights into the dataset.

4)Correlation Heatmap: Created a heatmap to visualize the correlation between different variables in the dataset.
